## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fetch API
- Advice API

### What I learned

This was my first API project, and I had a lot of fun. This challenge was  a great into to APIs, especially since I am a beginner at JS. It was cnfusing at first, but once I got the first slip advice, it was easy to understand that you then had to access the slip id to change the title number. Once I had the "ah-ha" moment, it all made sense!
